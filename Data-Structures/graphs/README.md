# Graphs

## Description/Challenge
Implement a graph. The graph should have an AddEdge, GetNodes, GetNeighbors, and Size method. The AddEdge method will add a new edge to your nodes in the graph. The GetNodes method will get all nodes in the graph from an adjacency list. The GetNeighbors method will get all of the nodes connected to a given parent node. The Size method will return the count of how many nodes are in the graph.
