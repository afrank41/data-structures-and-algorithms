# Linked List

## Description/Challenge
Implement a singly linked list with functionality to Add, Append, AddBefore, AddAfter, Print, and Find. The project should have a Node class with a value and next property. The project should also include a LinkedList class with a head and current property as well as methods that define the different behaviors it has.

## Linked List Methods
1. Print()
    * This methods prints all values of the nodes in a linked list
    * Big O Time: O(n)
    * Big O Space: O(1)

2. Add()
    * This method adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list
    * Big O Time: O(1)
    * Big O Space: O(1)

3. Append()
    * This method adds a new node at the end of a linked list
    * Big O Time: O(n)
    * Big O Space: O(1)

4. AddBefore()
    * This method adds a new node before an existing node of a linked list
    * Big O Time: O(n)
    * Big O Space: O(1)

5. AddAfter()
    * This method adds a new node after an existing node of a linked list
    * Big O Time: O(n)
    * Big O Space: O(1)

4. Find()
    * This method finds a node in a linked list and returns that node
    * Big O Time: O(n)
    * Big O Space: O(1)
