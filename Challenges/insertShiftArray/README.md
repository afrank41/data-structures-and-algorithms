# Insert Shift Array

## Challenge
Write a method called InsertShiftArray that takes in an array of integers and an integer value. This method needs to take the values of the integer array and the input integer and place them into a new array. The input integer needs to be at the middle index of the new array. Return the new array of integers.

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Big O Time = O(n)
	- We have to create a new array and iterate through that array to insert values at each index

2. Big O Space = O(n)
	- This solution requires us to instantiate a new array that has a length of 1 greater than the input array
