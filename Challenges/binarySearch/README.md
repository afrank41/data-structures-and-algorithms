# Insert Shift Array

## Challenge
Write a method called BinarySearch that takes in a sorted integer array and an integer. This method will search through the input array for the input integer and return the index of that integer. If the integer is not found it will return -1.

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Big O Time = O(log n)
	- This solution only loops through half of the input array at most at a time

2. Big O Space = O(1)
	- This solution does not involve creating new arrays or variables that need space allocated to them

## Solution
