# Nth Node From End

## Challenge
Write a method that takes in an integer value and finds the nth node from the end of a linked list. The method then returns the value of the node found. It is assumed you have access to the LinkdList class and Node class from the linked list implementation challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Big O Time = O(n)
	- This solution iterates through a linked list to find the node needed

2. Big O Space = O(1)
	- This solution does not need to allocate more memory such as instantiating a new linked list to function
