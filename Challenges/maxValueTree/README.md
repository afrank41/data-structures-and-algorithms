# Breadth First Traversal

## Challenge
Create a method called BreadthFirst that takes in a binary tree as input. This method should conduct a breadth first traversal of the input tree. While doing the traversal it should print the value of each node.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time = O(n)<br>
	- This method needs to hit every node within a binary tree to check values and output them.

Big O Space = O(w)<br>
	- This method conducts a breadth first traversal so at worst the queue length will be the width of the tree.
