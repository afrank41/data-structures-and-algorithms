# Breadth First Traversal

## Challenge
Create a method called MaxValue that takes in a binary tree as input and outputs the max value in that tree. 

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time = O(n)<br>
	- This method needs to hit every node within a binary tree to check values.

Big O Space = O(h)<br>
	- This method conducts a depth first traversal and the space it takes is dependent on the height of the tree.
